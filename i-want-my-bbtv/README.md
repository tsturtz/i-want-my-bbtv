# I want my - I want my - I want my BBTV 👩🏽‍🎤

_A mobile app for my wife (and me sometimes)_ 🙃: randomly choose which of our favorite tv shows or movies to rewatch.

#### Tech
- React Native / Expo
- RN tools: Elements / Navigation
- TMDb (The Movie Database)
- **TODO** - _Some DB solution for storing and manipulating content_

#### Todo
- [ ] set up react context for app state (TMDb **/configuration** and stuff)
- [ ] Some DB solution for storing and manipulating content
- [ ] Add items and delete items. **Adding items should be based on TMDb autocomplete as a means of validation)**
- [ ] truncate overview based on number of lines
- [ ] generate game-show spinner segments based on number of options (maybe with text of the show/movie or category imagery)
